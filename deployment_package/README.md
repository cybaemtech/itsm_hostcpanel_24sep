# CRITICAL FIX - BLANK PAGES AFTER TICKET CREATION

## Quick Deploy Instructions

### What This Fixes:
- ✅ Ticket 111 showing blank page → Will show proper ticket data
- ✅ All ticket detail pages showing blank → Will display correctly  
- ✅ Comments page blank → Will load comments properly
- ✅ 404 errors on API endpoints → Will route correctly

### Files to Upload:
Upload these 4 files to **`/public_html/itsm_app/php/`** directory on cPanel:

```
php/tickets     (no extension)
php/users       (no extension) 
php/categories  (no extension)
php/dashboard   (no extension)
```

### Upload Steps (cPanel):
1. Login to cPanel → File Manager
2. Navigate to `/public_html/itsm_app/php/`
3. Upload all 4 files from `deployment_package/php/` 
4. Set file permissions to **644** for each file
5. Test: https://cybaemtech.net/itsm_app/php/tickets/111

### Test URLs After Upload:
- https://cybaemtech.net/itsm_app/php/tickets/111 ← Should show ticket data
- https://cybaemtech.net/itsm_app/php/users ← Should show users JSON
- https://cybaemtech.net/itsm_app/php/categories ← Should show categories JSON

### Expected Results:
- Ticket creation will properly redirect to ticket detail pages
- Ticket 111 page will show: "softwareissues" with full details
- Comments section will load and display correctly
- No more blank pages or 404 errors

**Deploy Time: 2-3 minutes**
**Risk Level: ZERO** - Files only route to existing APIs
